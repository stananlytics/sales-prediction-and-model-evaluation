Project Description

This project forecasts monthly sales for Arbella Supermart using data from January 2022 to December 2024 to predict 2025 performance.
Machine learning models—Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVR—were implemented and evaluated with MSE, MAE, and R², alongside AIC and BIC for model fit. 
Holt’s linear trend method was also applied for time series forecasting. Results show Random Forest provides the most accurate predictions, 
offering a practical framework for data-driven retail sales forecasting and decision-making.
